# Tutorial

## Welcome

Thank you for considering CRNA for your next big project! Let's get started shall we?

Firstly, keep the following in mind in case you encounter an issue during development:
    - The documentation is your best friend, it explains how to use all functions and explains the purpose of all variables and types. Documentation can be found [here](https://th3t3chn0g1t.github.io/CRNA)
    - All types have memory management covered, don't worry yourself with it and just use the initialization function provided in headers
    - If you have crash or bug, don't be afraid to use a debugger to peek at the running of your code. Use ```make debug``` to enter debugging

With that out of the way, let's move onto your first program
